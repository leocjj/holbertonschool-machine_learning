    How do you slice a vector/matrix?
    What are element-wise operations?
    How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?
    What is the dot product?
    What is matrix multiplication?
    What is Numpy?

### Requirementes - Python Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
    Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.5)
    All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc
