### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
#### General
    What is probability?
    Basic probability notation
    What is independence? What is disjoint?
    What is a union? intersection?
    What are the general addition and multiplication rules?
    What is a probability distribution?
    What is a probability distribution function? probability mass function?
    What is a cumulative distribution function?
    What is a percentile?
    What is mean, standard deviation, and variance?
    Common probability distributions


## Requirementes

### General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
    All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Mathematical Approximations

For the following tasks, you will have to use various irrational numbers and functions. Since you are not able to import any libraries, please use the following approximations:

    pi = 3.1415926536
    e = 2.7182818285

## Built With

* Ubuntu 16.04
* Python 3.5
* Pycodestyle 2.5
