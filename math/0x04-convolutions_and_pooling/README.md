### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
#### General
    What is a convolution?
    What is max pooling? average pooling?
    What is a kernel/filter?
    What is padding?
    What is “same” padding? “valid” padding?
    What is a stride?
    What are channels?
    How to perform a convolution over an image
    How to perform max/average pooling over an image

## Built With
