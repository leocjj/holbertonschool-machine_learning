### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    What is a determinant? How would you calculate it?
    What is a minor, cofactor, adjugate? How would calculate them?
    What is an inverse? How would you calculate it?
    What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors? How would you calculate them?
    What is definiteness of a matrix? How would you determine a matrixâ€™s definiteness?
