General
    What is the confusion matrix?
    What is type I error? type II?
    What is sensitivity? specificity? precision? recall?
    What is an F1 score?
    What is bias? variance?
    What is irreducible error?
    What is Bayes error?
    How can you approximate Bayes error?
    How to calculate bias and variance
    How to create a confusion matrix

## Requirementes


    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
    Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15) and tensorflow (version 1.12)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.4)
    All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import numpy as np and/or import tensorflow as tf
    You should not import any module unless it is being used
    You are not allowed to use the keras module in tensorflow
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc
