### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General
* What is Keras?
* What is a model?
* How to instantiate a model (2 ways)
* How to build a layer
* How to add regularization to a layer
* How to add dropout to a layer
* How to add batch normalization
* How to compile a model
* How to optimize a model
* How to fit a model
* How to use validation data
* How to perform early stopping
* How to measure accuracy
* How to evaluate a model
* How to make a prediction with a model
* How to access the weights/outputs of a model
* What is HDF5?
* How to save and load a model’s weights, a model’s configuration, and the entire model
