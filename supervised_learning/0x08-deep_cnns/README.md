### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

* What is a convolutional layer?
* What is a pooling layer?
* Forward propagation over convolutional and pooling layers
* Back propagation over convolutional and pooling layers
* How to build a CNN using Tensorflow and Keras

## Built With
